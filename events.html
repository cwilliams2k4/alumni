                <h2>ASU Cares</h2><strong>Homeless Children's Playtime Project <br> </strong> <p><strong>Saturday April 4<br> 11 a.m. &ndash; 2 p.m.<br> </strong></p> 
                <p>This year in connection with the nationwide ASU Cares Month, the National Capital Chapter is partnering with the Homeless Children's Playtime Project to prepare their Spring Backpack Distribution. These backpacks are filled with school supplies and activity kits to help ensure children have enough supplies for the last portion of the school year. These bags are distributed in time for spring break when children are often in the shelter all day. Volunteers will be stuffing, sorting and boxing backpacks by shelter site and age.</p>

                <p>In conjunction with this project, we are raising money to purchase books for these children through Usborne Books &amp; More's Literacy for a Lifetime program. This program will match any amount we raise by 50%, once we hit $200! Our goal is to raise $500 which will in turn be $750 worth of books for the Homeless Children's Playtime Project! If you can't volunteer on April 4, <strong><a href="http://asualumni.org/redirect.aspx?linkID=103253&eid=772465">please consider giving generously. </a></strong><br> </p>
